# Micro-Frontend Mindmaps

#### What

This repository contains mindmaps we have created about Micro-Frontend based on public information.  As all of the information is already in the public domain, please feel free to use and share these mindmaps however you like.  

#### What is Micro-Frontend ?

Microfrontends are the technical representation of a business subdomain, they provide strong boundaries with clear contracts, also they avoid sharing logic with other subdomains

#### Defining Micro-Frontends

Identifying micro-frontends becomes quite straightforward. Understanding how users behave is of great use in determining our micro-frontends. You can read Luca Mezzalira's full article [here](https://medium.com/dazn-tech/identifying-micro-frontends-in-our-applications-4b4995f39257) for more details.

#### Composition of Micro-frontends

Analyzing how different frameworks can be used with different micro frontends on the same page.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Composition of Micro-frontends]-->A1[Client-side composition];
  A[Composition of Micro-frontends]-->A2[Edge-side composition];
  A[Composition of Micro-frontends]-->A3[Server-side composition];
  A[Composition of Micro-frontends]-->A4[Build Time Composition];
```

##### 1. Client-side composition

Client Side Composition is one of the patterns that combine Fragments on client-side

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Client-side composition]-->B1[Fragments]
  A1[Client-side composition]-->B2[Libraries]
  B2[Libraries]-->C1[single-spa/single-spa]
  B2[Libraries]-->C2[frintjs/frint]
  B2[Libraries]-->C3[smapiot/piral]
```

##### 2. Edge-side composition
Basically its combination of client side and server side composition to take the advantages of CDN caching.
Idea behind edge-side composition – fragments are stitched together, close to the client. 

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Edge-side composition]-->B1[Lambda Edge]
  A1[Edge-side composition]-->B2[Rendering Example]
  B1[Lambda Edge]-->C1[AWS Lambda CloudFront]
  B2[Rendering Example]-->D1[Next js using Lambda Edge and Serverless Framework]
  B2[Rendering Example]-->D2[Cloudflare Workers using a framework called Flareact]
```


##### 3. Server-side composition
Pattern that assembles Fragments on the server side.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Server-side composition]-->B1[Layout Server]
  A1[Server-side composition]-->B2[Fragments Server]
  A1[Server-side composition]-->B3[Fragment Gateway]
  A1[Server-side composition]-->B4[Libraries]
  B4[Libraries]-->C1[Ara Framework]
  B4[Libraries]-->C2[OpenComponents]
  B4[Libraries]-->C3[Piral]
  B4[Libraries]-->C4[Tailor]
```

##### 4. Build Time Composition
Build Time Composition assembles Fragments at build time, not at client or server. Publish each micro frontend as a package, and have the container application include them all as library dependencies.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Build Time Composition]-->B1[Shared libraries]
  A1[Build Time Composition]-->B2[Static Site Generators]
  A1[Build Time Composition]-->B3[Bit]
```

#### Micro-Frontends Communication

There are sometimes UI fragments belonging to different teams that need to interact or communicate. When a user adds an item to the basket by clicking the buy button, other micro frontends such as the mini basket want to be notified to update their content accordingly. 

##### 1. User interface communication

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[User interface communication]-->B1[Parent to fragment]
  A1[User interface communication]-->B2[Fragment to parent]
  A1[User interface communication]-->B3[Fragment to fragment]
  A1[User interface communication]-->B4[Publish Subscribe with the Broadcast Channel API]

```

##### 2. Sharing state

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A1[Sharing state]-->B1[Web Workers]
  A1[Sharing state]-->B2[Props and callbacks]
  A1[Sharing state]-->B3[Custom Events]
  A1[Sharing state]-->B4[Pub Sub library]
  A1[Sharing state]-->B5[Custom implementation]
```
